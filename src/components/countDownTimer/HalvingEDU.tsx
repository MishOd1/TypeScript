        now the qustion is if the reward was at the beggining 50 bitcoins (worth 800,000$ at todays price)
        <br></br> and now the reward is only 6.25 bitcoins after the last halving (worth around 100,000$)
         then, <br></br>minning must be out of fasion!?<br></br>
        the answer is is simply <b>NO</b>, bitcoin, and bitcoin minning is and will always be in high demand!<br></br><br></br>
        the reason simply is that when the reward was 50 back in 2009 price was below 100$ so the reward<br></br>
        was equlivent to 5000$, on the other hand although the reward is only 6.25 bitcoins today, these 6.25 bitcoins are worth 100,000$<br></br>
        when we compare that 100,000$ to the 5000$ earlier, it only makes sense that bitcoin and bitcoin minning will only grow in popularity! <br></br>
        this simple curve of supply and demand, and mining reward is the cause of the price increasing<br></br>
        it is called in finance by the name of deflation, meaning that demand will increase, while supply is stable or decreasing in bitcoins case which results in the price deflating (increasing in value).<br></br>
